This project is part of the eCornell Machine Learning course, where the goal is to follow the machine learning life cycle and implement a model to solve a predictive problem using one of four datasets. The selected dataset is used to build a DataFrame, define a machine learning (ML) problem, and go through the entire process of data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

Datasets
Census Income Dataset (censusData.csv): Census information from 1994.
For this project, the Census Income Dataset is used.


The project follows these steps:
Build the DataFrame: Load the dataset and prepare it for analysis.
Define the ML Problem: Formulate a predictive problem based on the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the data distribution and patterns.
Define the Project Plan: Outline how to approach the ML problem.
Model Implementation:
Prepare the data (handling missing values, encoding, scaling, etc.).
Train and evaluate different machine learning models.
Improve the model's performance using tuning techniques.

Key Features
Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
Building and evaluating classification models.
Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
